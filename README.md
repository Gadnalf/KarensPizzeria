Tired of getting harsh reviews in your pizzeria games? Now it's your turn to call the shots.

In the battlefield known as the Pelp pizza review site, most do not survive. Will you be one of the glorious few who rise the ranks to earn their place among the champions of the realm? Or will you collapse into crushing debt?
